# Cacao Disease Detection Model
Indonesia is a significant player in the global cocoa industry, being ranked third in terms of cocoa production. However, the cocoa industry in Indonesia has been struggling with decreased productivity, which is attributed to various factors. According to Ariningsih (2021), one of the biggest reasons for the decreased cocoa productivity is the lack of proper plant maintenance, coupled with pest and disease outbreaks that have affected the crops. As a result, the country has experienced a decline in cocoa production for three consecutive years, with a projected decrease of 0.97% in 2021 compared to the previous year (BPS, 2021).

To address this issue, it is essential to find solutions that can help improve cocoa productivity, quality, and disease control in Indonesia's cocoa industry. One possible solution is the development of a machine learning model that can identify and classify cocoa diseases for quicker detection and better prevention and treatment methods. This model can provide insights on cocoa diseases, enabling better understanding, and effective prevention measures.

According to research, crop diseases are the leading cause of significant crop losses worldwide, including cocoa (Savary et al., 2019). Early detection and management of disease outbreaks are crucial to preventing yield losses and ensuring productivity. By developing a machine learning model that can quickly and accurately detect cocoa diseases, farmers can take necessary steps to manage and control the spread of the disease before it causes significant losses.

Furthermore, by identifying and classifying cocoa diseases through machine learning models, experts can gather more accurate and comprehensive data that can improve our broader understanding of these diseases. This knowledge can inform the development of better prevention and control measures and strategies that can help ensure the sustainability and growth of the cocoa industry.

In conclusion, the development of a machine learning model that can identify and classify cocoa diseases can significantly improve the situation in Indonesia's cocoa industry, where disease outbreaks are a significant problem. By enabling prompt disease detection and prevention measures, such models have the potential to increase cocoa productivity, improve cocoa quality, and enhance the livelihoods of cocoa farmers.
